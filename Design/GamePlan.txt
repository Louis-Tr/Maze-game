Introduction:

In "Westward: Cyborg's Odyssey", players assume the role of a Cyborg navigating a vast forest maze from the starting point to the exit, eluding monsters, and collecting rewards. The game focuses on strategy, quick reflexes, and understanding the behaviors of the monsters.

Cyborg (Main Character):

- Representation: Distinctive image.
- Movement: Keyboard-controlled. Can move up, down, left, or right to an adjacent cell unless blocked by a barrier or wall.
- Initial Location: Start cell on the board map.
- Movement Behavior: Moves at most one cell at each “tick” of the game.
- Rewards Collection: Collects and removes rewards from the field, adding to the total score.
- Punishments: Loses points when coming into contact with traps. The game concludes if the score goes negative or reaches 0.

Monster:

Monsters serve as the primary antagonists:
- Representation: Distinct images for each monster type.
- Movement Behavior: 
  - When the Cyborg is within a 4x4 grid vicinity of a monster, the monster gives chase.
  - If not, the monster wanders randomly throughout the board.
- Effect on Cyborg: Direct contact with a monster results in the Cyborg's demise (Game Over), unless under the influence of a special reward.

Rewards:

1. Regular Rewards: Scattered throughout the map. Each one collected augments the player's score.
2. Special Rewards: Granting unique boons:
   - Protective Cover: Bestows a short-lived shield.
   - Invincibility State: For a brief period, any monster touched by the Cyborg is vanquished.
3. Bonus Rewards: 
   - Appears randomly during gameplay and disappears after a few ticks.
   - Score: Worth more than regular rewards.

Punishments:

- Traps: Strategically positioned around the map, triggering them deducts points from the player's score.

Barriers:

1. Walls: Surround the board with two openings – the start and end points.
2. Additional Barriers: Randomly placed on the board to create a maze-like structure.

Board:

- Structure: A 2D grid surrounded by walls.
- Initial Setup: At the start of the game, the board shows walls, barriers, regular rewards, traps, the Cyborg, and monsters.
